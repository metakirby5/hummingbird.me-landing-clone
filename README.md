# COGS 187a Assignment 1

- Name: Ethan Chan
- PID: A11221627

## Part 1

- Option chosen: 2
- Website chosen: [hummingbird.me](https://hummingbird.me/)
- Entry point: `index.html`

### Tools Used

Note: you don't need to install any of these! Everything comes bundled in this
folder, and all the HTML and CSS files have been compiled.

- [Bower](http://bower.io/):
  a package manager for the web
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/):
  an HTML preprocessor which compiles lightweight syntax into HTML
- [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/):
  a CSS preprocessor which compiles lightweight syntax into CSS
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/):
  an easy to use, web-oriented Javascript library
- [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/):
  to ensure consistent cross-browser rendering
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/):
  for the facebook font icon
- Fonts:
    - [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) and
    - [Klavika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klavika)

### Key Differences

- There is no gift box in the lower left corner, since it requires
  extensive svg manipulation.
- There are no loading animations.
- The "Recent Posts" section is a static image.
- The introduction text in the hero section is centered relative to the full
  height of the page, rather than the height of the page minus the navbar.
- On mobile, the "Login" and "Register" buttons in the navbar don't switch
  order. I'm not sure why they do this on the actual website.

### Things to Note

- I have also implemented the mobile version of the site - check it out by
  resizing the screen width.
- None of the page links go anywhere.

### jQuery Elements

- Navbar, which inverts colors on scroll.
- Downward-facing chevron, which smoothly scrolls to the "About" section when
  clicked.
